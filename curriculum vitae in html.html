<u><h2>Experience</h2></u>
	<p>	
		<strong>Marks and Spencer, Team member, February 2016 – September 2016</strong>
		For seven months I was involved as part of the team at M&S  in Sutton station. This involved preparing the in-store bakery, stocking, manning the tills and making coffee for early morning passengers. This has helped me develop both customer service and inter-personal skills due to interacting with a wide range of customers and also constantly having to work withing a team which had to be efficient and dynamic.

    <p>
		<strong>Michael wisher Bar, Work/food service, July 2015 – January 2016</strong> Worked part-time at Wembley Arena part of both working at the bar and preparing food for customers. This involved very quick and rapid service, and required juggling several different tasks at the same time. Continuously swapping between teams involved constant attentive communication. 
   </p>
	<p>		
		<strong>Oxford Education summer camps, Activity leader, July 2014 </strong>For a month I worked in London within a summer camp which involved guiding foreign non-English speaking teenagers from the ages of 12-17, either guiding them through London or planning evening activities. Similar to scouting activities these could both be physical but also many academic activities which were primarily to aid in English speaking skills. Activities were often thought up by us  activity leaders which helped develop intuitive methods towards managing students
